function [F1opt,fphoto_star] = CellPhoto(Irr)
%UNTITLED3 computes the optimal (maximum) value of f_photo (alpha_photo in
%CellCNP) by balancing the trade off between photosystems 1 & 2 (carbon
%fixation & electron transport?). needed to run CellCNP
%   calculate this once before running the cell model. output field will be
%   constant over all iterations of the parameter optimization. function of
%   only temperature and light, which are both fixed fields in OCIM-BGC
%   INPUTS:
%       Irr is light level in microeinsteins per m^2 per second
%       T is temperature in Celsius (may not be needed)

% This function calculates the carbon gathering efficiency of 1 unit of
% the photosynthetic apparatus. It is based on a paper by Geider and
% Talmy. This model involves optimizing photosynthetic allocations
% between carbon fixation and photo capture/electron transport.

% The model assumes the photosynthetic apparatus is divided into two
% compartments: F1 stands for the carbon fixing compartment and
% F2 stands for the light harvesting compartment. Associated with each of
% these compartments are rate constants k1 and k2
% F1 and F2 have as units grams of carbon.

% The maximum photosynthesis rate is: Pmax = min([k1*F1,k2*F2]).

% The actual photosynthesis rate depends on the irradiance and the
% investments F1 and F2 according to f_Photo = Pmax*(1-exp(-alpha_ph *
% PhiM * F2 * Irr / Pmax))
